# Flipkart
In this project i have automated test cases for Flipkart page.
I have made the project in two parts.
The first part is to first go on the Flipkart home page and then click on search button.
Then navigating to search page and sorting them based on ascending order of the price.
The next part consists of the same flow as the above section.
The only addition to this section is to click on the  2nd product and add to cart.
I have used Selenium and Eclipse.
